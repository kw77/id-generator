# id-generator
A node module to create IDs in a particular letter/number format (random or predetermined)

This is a simple module for creating IDs of a particular letter/number sequence but, importantly, with the ability to have a predetermined seeded random set of IDs. This is intended for testing a student database application where student IDs are in the format LLNNNNNN (initials and student number). I'll try to make the generator more generic in due course (allowing other combinations for more reuse).
